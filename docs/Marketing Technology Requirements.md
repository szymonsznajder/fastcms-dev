# Marketing Technology requirements

## Narrative

When we're creating content like blogs, articles, case studies, etc. we need a way of defining some information to be passed into analytics. This is the information we need:
Content Type (e.g. blog, article, webinar, case study)
Content Title
Content Topic (e.g. analytics, CDP, DAM)
Content Technology (e.g. AEP, AEM)
Content Company (e.g. Techem, Aston Martin, FK)
Content Author  ***IS SAME AS AUTHOR***

Some of the information may not be applicable, e.g. Content Company may be left blank if there are no companies referenced (would typically only be used for case studies)

Is there a way that we can build this into the metadata of the page so that the info can be easily passed into the data layer for Adobe Analytics to pick up? Added to Metadata use field names without spaces
e.g ContentType = contenttype

It would be the responsibility of whoever is creating the piece of content to provide all this information. Is it possible to have a section in the Google Doc for the page where this info can be entered? Maybe added to the Metadata section below?
